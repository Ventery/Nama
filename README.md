*Nama* is a Japanese Riichi Mahjong server/client based on Qt/OpenGL.
Notable features include network play with a built-in chat server and
AI as a plugin which can be toggled on/off for all four players.
This can be used to let different AI algorithms compete with each other
or just be played against for fun.


## Notes

- Requires Qt 5 for building (developed on Qt 5.3)
- Tested on macOS and Windows (haven't tested on Linux, but likely to work
  with very minor or no modifications)
- Compiled binaries can be found in
  [releases page](https://github.com/junosan/Nama/releases)
